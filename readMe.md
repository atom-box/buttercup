# Evan Genest Web Developer Portfolio
* [My portfolio](https://atom-box.github.io/buttercup).  It is my in-development version. 

## To do:
* The to do list is now in Trello.

## Next cards to add in Projects div: 
* Drum Machine / Drum machine / Serve sounds to a browser, in plain JS
* All True Olympics / Searcher / SQLite
* Look closely: Boss-Machine is kind of cool.  Build your own, like the Alice-server.  Merge it with Handlebars Commenter by Hahn.
