# Evan Genest Web Developer Portfolio
* [This view of my portfolio](https://github.com/atom-box/buttercup/blob/master/docs/index.html) is not yet polished for release.  It is my in-development version. 
* 5/25/2019: Deployment is currently avoiding any Gulp build.  I'm just doing a straight sync from SRC -> 
BUILD using Beyond Compare.  Then, SFTP into non-root, and finally MV as root@digital ocean, from HOME to 
/var/www/littlefurnace.com

## To do:
* The to do list is now in Trello.

## Next cards to add in Projects div: 
* Drum Machine / Drum machine / Serve sounds to a browser, in plain JS
* All True Olympics / Searcher / SQLite
* Look closely: Boss-Machine is kind of cool.  Build your own, like the Alice-server.  Merge it with Handlebars Commenter by Hahn.
