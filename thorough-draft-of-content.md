I'm Evan Genest.  I've taught students C, Python, and Javascript. I'm working now in Javascript and Elm.  My technical blog explains the difference tool Beyond Compare.  I enjoy speaking and getting out from behind the screen for team planning and public speaking.

## Key Skills
* Public Speaking:  presented talks at Milwaukee Code Camp and Madpy Meetup, both on the Elm Language.
* Teaching:  I lectured as a TA for several years at The Ohio State University and Hunter CUNY in New York City.  I ran  diverse curricula for  diverse public school audiences in New York City and elsewhere.
* Web Development: I've taught myself front and back end development and have deployed the resulting projects to my Nginx server at Digital Ocean.
* Interpersonal: after leaving teaching I joined two teams of facilitators: LVN.org (a collaboration of MIT Media Labs and Kathy Cramer) and Nehemiah Center (a weekly history class discussing race).  I trained my eleventh graders at Madison East HS to run Kanban and have daily standup meetings.

## Projects

## Experience
I work at a Software as Product company, Scooter Software.  I answer emails all day long about protocols, file storage, and operating system arcania for Linux, Mac, and Windows.  It has been a great supplement to my understanding of programming for the backend of the stack. 
I put some of this knowledge to work troubleshooting my personal server on Digital Ocean.

## Education
* Codecademy: ES6; Udacity: Relational Databases with PostGreSQL; FreeCodeCamp: JQuery; Johns Hopkins University MOOC: CSS & JS for Web Design; Harvard MOOC: CS50 [I took the course and then taught the course for high school]; Udemy: Gulp and BEM Principles for Organizing CSS.
* The Ohio State University: Thesis and Master of Science for Organic Chemistry
* Oakland University: Bachelor of Science for Environmental Science
* Meetups: Madison Area Software Developers, MadPy, Big Data Madison

## About me
I am ever restless to learn new things and go to new places. I'm a power user of the public library.  Being a teacher gave me deep humility; it made me a fan of deep listening, an aspect of facilitation.
